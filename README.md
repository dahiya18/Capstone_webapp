# Aurora Testbed Management Center

This project provides researchers with a Testbed Management Centre that can receive and visualize data from multiple sources. A research intersection has been setup at the UBC Campus where students and researchers can safely configure roadside equipment and test new sensors and smart traffic devices.

## Project Overview

* The system architecture of this project is grouped into two major sections, the Testbed Management Center(TMC) and the Mock Intersection. The TMC shown on the left side is a command center designed to monitor live traffic information and the Mock Intersection contains a system of sensors and controllers designed to collect traffic information.

* The mock intersection contains some sensory units whose feeds need to be displayed in a web interface.

* The traffic signal controller is responsible for the signal phase timing of the traffic lights and the V2X Hub acts as the processing unit responsible for relaying messages to the TMC.

* The main deliverable for this project is a functional AURORA Testbed Management Centre (TMC), i.e., a set of servers and monitors that receives data from the smart intersection and visualizes it with the help of Web Interface.
